# Welcome to 2024

No clue how long this will go, but going to try. 

My goals for this year are as follows:
* Make it to day 19 (the day before I fly out of state and will probably not be able to work on this anymore for the year)
* Level up my Pythonic maturity by:
* Starting each challenge with a proper unit test
* Do not use any prints, only debuggers and (if necessary) logging libraries
* Spend 30 minutes refactoring for optimization or readability or both

I'm sharing my results with my friends in various channels, so if you're reading this then good luck on the leaderboard!
